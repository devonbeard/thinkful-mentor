// 1) The app must lead the user through a set of questions.
//     - The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one.

// 2) Users should be able to to input their answer to each question, with radio buttons or some other appropriate interface.


// 3) When the user answers the last question, the app should show his or her overall score.


// 4) Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll probably want to store your list of questions in an array.

// Additional:

// 1) Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5")

// 2) Let the user know their score so far

// 3) Let the user know if their previous response was correct
